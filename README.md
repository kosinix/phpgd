# PHP GD

An image manipulation library in PHP that wraps around PHP GD

## Why Another Image Lib?

It's my side project and is not ready for "enterprisy" projects. Use at your own discretion.

The goal is to:

- Create a practical and easy-to-use API.
- Have the widest possible compatibility by using PHP GD.
- Limit the scope to PHP GD only.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 5.3.3

## Installation
Download the zip and unzip it in your project folder.
Include the class:
```php
require_once 'src/autoloader.php';

```

## Usage

See [examples/index.php](examples/index.php) on how to use.

## Test

- Go to the project folder and run phpunit in the command line.
- You need to have phpunit installed globally.

## License

- MIT
